## Netflix Data Analysis

### About
On this webpage we will be sharing data visualizations using a database containing shows and movies that have been or are on Netflix. 

### Datasets

* [Netflix Shows Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows)
  * This is our main dataset that has information about movies and TV shows that have been on netflix throughout its lifespan. Most of the columns in our data set is made up of objects so it can be a little difficult to work with but if your able to set the dataset up good you can create some interesting visualizations.

* [IMDB rating data](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/)
  * I dont think we will all be using this data but in [Connor's](Connor) section he'll go over how he used the IMDB data and what he found using it. Using the link above will take you to the datasets documentation and in the documentation there is a link to the download for the data.
